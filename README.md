# Python

Programming is the art of explaining to a computer what you want it to do, in exact detail and in a language that the computer can understand. Programming is only one part of computer science, but it is the most basic and most central part. It is an activity that requires you to think logically, to solve problems, to express yourself clearly, and often to endure a certain amount of frustration as you try to get your programs to work. The result, though, can be very rewarding. 

In this course, you will learn and use the Python programming language. This course will be focused on the training of the students so that they would be proficient in Python Programming. Therefore, the grade will be given based on how well the students are at Python programming for any given problems. Then, students will learn graphic module, Numpy module, Matplotlib module and TensorFlow.
